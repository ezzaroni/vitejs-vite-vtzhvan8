## Introduction

Mizumaret transforms the way we discover, fractionalize, and trade real-world assets by offering a seamless and permissionless platform across sectors like real estate, music royalties, commodities, and more. It integrates ERC-6960 to manage ownership and usage rights, paving the way for new asset management and monetization models.

## Key Features

### Dual-Layer Token Standard (ERC-6960)

Mizumaret uses ERC-6960 to represent both ownership (mainId) and usage (subId) rights within a single token structure. This allows for flexible fractionalization, leasing, staking, and granular rights management for RWAs.

### Real World Asset Tokenization Engine

Mizumaret facilitates the issuance, fractionalization, and trading of tangible assets like real estate and commodities on a permissionless blockchain platform.

### Pharos-Native Integration

Integrated with Pharos, Mizumaret ensures high throughput, low-latency transactions, and seamless interaction with other protocols within the ecosystem.

### Fractional Ownership & Accessibility

Users can easily participate in high-value assets through fractional ownership, democratizing access to investment opportunities traditionally limited to large institutions.

## Why Mizumaret?

### Dual-Layer Token Standard for Flexible Ownership

Mizumaret's ERC-6960 standard enables programmable fractional ownership and separation of asset utility, surpassing the limitations of ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155.

### Democratized Access to High-Value Assets

By enabling fractional ownership of real-world assets, Mizumaret promotes inclusivity in investment markets, catering to both retail and institutional investors.

### Pharos Ecosystem Integration

Mizumaret leverages Pharos' performance and interoperability, enabling seamless interactions across decentralized applications and financial protocols.

### Trust-Minimized Asset Lifecycle Management

Mizumaret supports permissionless issuance and management of RWA tokens, ensuring transparency and decentralization throughout the asset lifecycle.

## Conclusion

Mizumaret empowers a new era of on-chain finance by bridging real-world assets with decentralized systems, offering transparency, liquidity, and innovative asset management solutions.
